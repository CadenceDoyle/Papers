## Linear Programming
In 2021, I authored a paper for AACE named [Using Linear Porgramming to Create Optimal Budget Scenarios](https://github.com/CadenceDoyle/Papers/blob/main/Using%20Linear%20Programming%20to%20Create%20Optimal%20Budget%20Scenarios%20Final.docx). It will be published in AACE's journal, [Cost Engineering](https://web.aacei.org/resources/other-resources/magazines#:~:text=The%20Cost%20Engineering%20journal%2C%20a,Subscriptions%20are%20not%20available.), following their 2022 conference.

This paper explores the history of mathematical optimization in industry, and how my team applied it to the National Nuclear Security Administration's portfolio of equipment. Within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), federal program managers heavily rely on their contractors at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories to plan their budget. Each site is asked to prioritize investments internally, and communicate those priorities back to the program offices. Federal program managers must weigh competing priorities across all laboratories to make funding decisions. In the NNSA, program managers often wish to eliminate the most risk, which raises the question: “how can the enterprise ensure it is using its dollars to buy down the most amount of risk?” 

In this study, we deliver an analytical approach to create optimal budget scenarios. Using linear programming, an operations research technique, we are able to mathematically derive the “optimal” way to spend dollars on the recapitalization of programmatic equipment. Combining the risk score and the procurement cost for each piece of equipment, we translate this business question into a system of linear inequalities. Methods explored in this study do not provide a proposed budget for federal program managers. Instead, they facilitate a data-driven discussion between managers and laboratories. This process will enable federal program managers to make portfolio-wide decisions in an informed manner. 

## Natural Language Processing
In 2021, I co-authored a paper for ICEAA called [Comprehending the Chaos: Leveraging Text to Improve Analysis](https://github.com/CadenceDoyle/Papers/blob/main/ICEAA_Comprehending%20the%20Chaos_Combined_23Feb2021_Final.pdf).

This paper discusses the history of NLP, advancements that have been made in NLP and machine learning, and how commercial and academic applications of both can be leveraged within the cost community. To address a common data cleansing and normalization problem, the authors describe a use case for classifying data items based on line-item descriptions. The paper concludes with an applied example of the use of open source documentation, and how the documentation can be used to discover latent information on a set of programs that would have previously required significant human study.
